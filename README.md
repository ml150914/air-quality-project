Welcome to air-lab! A particulate matter sensor to measure the concentration of polluting particles at your location!

## What is air-lab? 

In the last years, attention toward environmental question arose consistently - we see the effect of global warming for instance. In particular
the pollution of air and soil is becoming more and more affecting out everyday life. Estimates talk about millions of death every year due to air pollution, due to 
natural or anthropic source. 

The idea of developing low-cost particulate matter sensor is almost [10 years old](https://amt.copernicus.org/preprints/amt-2015-331/amt-2015-331.pdf), with several 
studies and toolkit developed in this context. 

Here, we focus on a simple, cheap and scalable solution to out problem. Following [Rigacci's blog](https://www.rigacci.org/wiki/doku.php/doc/appunti/hardware/raspberrypi_air), we will create a particulate matter-weather station capable of measuring the concentration
of microscopic elements in our enviroment along with atmospheric-pressure, humidity percentage and room-temperature. 

This project started with Livia Conti, scientist and researcher at Italian Istituto Italiano di Fisica Nucleare (INFN) - Sezione di Padova, and then applied to the Air-Lab experience with Sabine Hemmer, technologyst at INFN - Sezione di Padova. The idea was to develope a cheap, scalable, easy to assemble and configure particulate matter sensor to promote the scientific knowledge and culture among the high-school students in Veneto (north-east of Italy). The project succeeded, and we presented it at [ICERI conference 2020](http://dx.doi.org/10.21125/iceri.2022.0794). 

This repo systematize the results, slim the codes and push forward the realization of the sensor, by including a public dashboard where data are automatically loaded and can be visible.
